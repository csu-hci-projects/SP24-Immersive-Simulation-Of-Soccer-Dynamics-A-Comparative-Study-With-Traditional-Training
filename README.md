# SP24-Immersive-Simulation-Of-Soccer-Dynamics-A-Comparative-Study-With-Traditional-Training

Welcome to the VR Soccer Training Project repository! This project aims to revolutionize soccer skill development by leveraging virtual reality (VR) technology. The prototype provides an immersive training experience that allows players to improve their skills in a realistic virtual environment.

## Overview

The VR Soccer Training Project is a collaborative effort to create a VR-based soccer training platform. The project utilizes Unity, C# scripting, and Blender to develop

realistic virtual environments and dynamic gameplay mechanics. By simulating various training scenarios, players can enhance their skills and performance on the soccer field.

## Requirements

- Unity Engine (version 2023.2.17 TS)
- Blender (version 4.1.0 LTS)
- MetaQuest 2/3 VR Headset capable or running the current version of Unity

## Installation

**Note:** This source code does NOT contain bothe the Library and UserSettings directories. This is normal and tehy will be built by unity whenthe project is compiled and run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open the project in Unity.
1. Install any necessary dependencies or plugins (all should be in Unity already but just in case).
1. Connect your VR headset to the system and controllers.
1. Run the project in the Unity Editor or build it for your target platform.
1. Once built open the app on a MetaQuest 2 VR Headset (Other HMDs may work but this was built with the Quest in mind)
1. Disconnect the controllers and esnure hand tracking is enabled

## Usage

Our project is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the VR soccer goalie simulator. To get started, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies, including Unity Game Engine and Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Once installed, open the project in Unity and customize settings as needed. Users can then launch the simulator and immerse themselves in the virtual environment, where they will assume the role of a soccer goalie. Follow on-screen prompts to block incoming shots and track your performance over multiple testing phases. Whether you're a sports enthusiast, researcher, or VR enthusiast, our project offers an engaging and interactive experience for users of all backgrounds. Some things you may notice include the lack of a start button, the app will start "kicking balls automatically".
